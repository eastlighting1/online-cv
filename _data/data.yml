career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
          I am a student in the Department of Computing at Gachon University. I am particularly interested in natural language processing, and I am studying data analysis using natural language processing and machine learning/deep learning in general. In addition to a career as a data analyst or AI engineer, I am also interested in becoming a business strategy expert or data-driven marketer based on IT companies.
      
          I prefer to organize and execute plans in a team rather than create something on my own, and I usually create long-term plans that can last beyond my hand rather than short-term plans of one year or less. Passion and imagination are my strengths, and I strive to ensure that persistence comes with passion.
