    title: About Me
    summary: |
          I am a student in the Department of Computing at Gachon University. I am particularly interested in natural language processing, and I am studying data analysis using natural language processing and machine learning/deep learning in general. In addition to a career as a data analyst or AI engineer, I am also interested in becoming a business strategy expert or data-driven marketer based on IT companies.
      
          I prefer to organize and execute plans in a team rather than create something on my own, and I usually create long-term plans that can last beyond my hand rather than short-term plans of one year or less. Passion and imagination are my strengths, and I strive to ensure that persistence comes with passion.

          가천대학교 소프트웨어학과에 재학 중인 학생입니다. 특별히 자연어처리에 관심이 많으며, 자연어처리를 이용한 데이터 분석과 머신러닝/딥러닝 전반에 대하여 흥미를 가지고 공부를 해나가고 있습니다. 데이터 분석가나 AI 공학자로서의 진로 외에도 IT기업을 기반으로 하는 경영전략 전문가나 데이터 기반 마케터로의 진출에도 관심이 많습니다.

          혼자서 무언가를 만들기보다는 팀 단위의 계획을 세우고 실행하는 것을 선호하며, 1년 이하의 단기 계획보다는 오래 지속될 수 있는 장기 계획을 주로 세웁니다. 열정과 상상력이 저의 강점이며, 열정 만큼 끈기가 따라올 수 있도록 노력합니다.
